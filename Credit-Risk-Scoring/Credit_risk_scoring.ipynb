    "## Credit Risk Scoring Project\n",
    "This project involves credit risk scoring. Imagine you want to buy a mobile phone, so you visit your bank to apply for a loan. You fill out an application form that requests various details, such as your income, the price of the phone, and the loan amount you need. The bank evaluates your application and assigns a score, ultimately deciding whether to approve or decline your request with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, our goal is to build a model that the bank can utilize to make informed decisions about lending money to customers. The bank can provide the model with customer information, and in return, the model will generate a risk score, indicating the likelihood of a customer defaulting on the loan. This risk score enables the bank to make well-informed lending decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach involves analyzing historical data from various customers and their loan applications. For each case, we have information about the requested loan amount and whether the customer successfully repaid the loan or defaulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Customer A –> OK\n",
    " * Customer B –> OK\n",
    " * Customer C –> DEFAULT\n",
    " * Customer D –> DEFAULT\n",
    " * Customer E –> OK\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "This problem can be framed as binary classification, where ‘y’ represents the target variable, and it can take on two values: 0 (OK) or 1 (DEFAULT). Our objective is to train a model to predict, for each new customer, the probability that they will default:\n",
    "\n",
    "g(xi) –> PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have ‘X,’ which encompasses all the customer information, and the target variable ‘y,’ which indicates the default probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: You can find the dataset at this [link](https://github.com/gastonstat/CreditScoring). The ‘Status’ variable in the dataset denotes whether the customer defaulted or not.\n",

    "      \n",
    "In part 1 of this chapter, “Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning,” we introduced the project, which is a binary classification problem aimed at predicting the probability of a client defaulting on a loan. Part 2 of this chapter is divided into two main sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preparation Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part, we focus on necessary preparation steps. This includes importing essential libraries, downloading the dataset, previewing the the CSV File, and performing an initial column format adaptation to ensure uniformity in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Transformation and Splitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part is dedicated to re-encoding categorical variables and performing the train/validation/test split, a crucial step in preparing our data for modeling and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation Steps – Part 1/2\n",
    "### Imports for this project\n",
    "For this project, we’ll need to import several essential libraries that we’re already familiar with. These libraries provide the foundation for our data analysis and machine learning tasks. The necessary libraries include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical and array operations in Python.<br>\n",
    "**Pandas**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing us to work with structured data efficiently.<br>\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn**: Scikit-Learn is a powerful machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for our classification task. This library we’ll import at a later point.<br>\n",
    "**Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is essential for data visualization, enabling us to create informative plots and charts.<br>\n",
    "**Seaborn**: Seaborn complements Matplotlib and simplifies the creation of aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By ensuring that we have these libraries at our disposal, we’ll be well-equipped to tackle the various tasks involved in our credit risk scoring project."

    "Building upon the necessary preparation steps outlined in the previous article, this section is dedicated to two critical processes: re-encoding categorical variables and performing the train/validation/test split, a crucial step in preparing our data for modeling and evaluation.\n",

    "## Data cleaning and preparation – Data Transformation and Splitting – Part 2/2\n",
    "Re-encoding the categorical variables\n",
    "To handle the categorical variables, we need to address a few important considerations. The R file in the repository provides insights into preprocessing this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    " **Missing Values**: The missing values are encoded as a series of nines (99999999). We’ll need to address how to handle these missing values.<br>\n",
    " **Categorical Variable Information**: The R file also offers information about the categorical variables. For example:<br>\n",
    " * Status: is encoded as ‘good’ (1) and ‘bad’ (2).\n",
    " * Home: includes categories like ‘rent,’ ‘owner,’ ‘priv,’ ‘ignore,’ ‘parents,’ and ‘other.’\n",
    " * Marital: encompasses ‘single,’ ‘married,’ ‘widow,’ ‘separated,’ and ‘divorced.’\n",
    " * Records: has ‘yes’ and ‘no.’\n",
    " * Job: includes ‘fixed,’ ‘partime,’ ‘freelance,’ and ‘other.’<br>\n",
    "To proceed, we’ll need to translate these numerical values back into their respective categorical strings. This ensures our data is more interpretable and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the ‘status’ variable, we examine the possible values: 1, 2, and 0. As previously mentioned, 1 corresponds to ‘good,’ and 2 corresponds to ‘bad.’ However, we also have one record with the value 0, which we’ll designate as ‘unknown.’\n",
    "\n",
    "To map these values accordingly, we can use the ‘map’ method. This method takes a dictionary that maps each original dataframe value to a new value.\n"

They are a versatile and interpretable way to make decisions and predictions based on a set of input features. Imagine a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch signifies a decision or outcome, and each leaf node provides a final prediction or classification.\n",

Then there is the next condition which can be true or false. … until there is the final decision ‘OK’ or ‘DEFAULT’"

    "This is called **overfitting**. Overfitting is when our model simply memorizes the data, but it memorizes in such a way that when it sees a new example it doesn’t know what to do with this example. So it memorizes the training data but it fails to generalize. The reason why this happens to decision trees is that the model creates a specific rule for each example. That works fine for training data, but it doesn’t work for any unseen example. The reason why this can happens is, that we let the tree grow too deep. If we restrict the tree to only grow up to three levels deep, the tree will learn rules that are less specific."
